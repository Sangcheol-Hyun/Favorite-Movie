  <h2>Bird man</h2>
  Former cinema <u>superhero</u> <strong>Riggan Thomson</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Keaton" target="_blank" title="Michael Keaton Wikipedia">Michael Keaton</a>) is mounting an ambitious Broadway production that he hopes will breathe new life into his stagnant career. It's risky, but he hopes that his creative gamble will prove that he's a real artist and not just a washed-up movie star.
